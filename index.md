# 👩‍💻 Hi, I'm Lisa!

Welcome to my GitHub Page! I'm currently a **Business Information Systems** student with a focus on *Business Engineering* at a university in Germany — but right now, I'm spending my semester abroad at **UC San Diego** in sunny California 🌴🌊.

## 🌍 Education

This semester, I’m diving into:

- Software Engineering
- Cryptography
- International Trade 

I love working on problems that involve **logic** and **mathematics**, which is why I chose these subjects — they challenge me in the best ways. I am also interested in gaining knowledge in the economic field.

## 💻 My Tools of Choice

Here’s a quick overview of my preferences as a programmer:

- 🛠️ **Editor:** Visual Studio Code  
- 🐍 **Language:** Python  
- 🌱 **Attitude:** Always curious, always learning  


## 🔒 Fun Fact

> I work at KPMG Germany as an **IT Consultant** in the field of Authorization Management — but I haven’t written a single line of code there… yet!  
> Hope that changes soon 😅
